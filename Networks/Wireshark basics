Gather ip- cmd prompt> ipconfig

Basic traffic filtering
All traffic= ip.addr == 10.185.114.96
Source= ip.src == 10.185.114.96
Destination= ip.dst == 10.185.114.96

Can filter ports + IP:
ip.addr == 10.185.114.96 && tcp.port == 443
ip.addr == 10.185.114.96 && udp.port == 53

Filtering the TCP handshake:
Gathering initial SYN data:
Tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # Initial SYN request
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1   #  Successful SYN/ ACK
tcp.flags.ack == 1 && tcp.flags.syn == 0   # Gathers data mid conversation
(+&& extras like port/ ip if need be)

Test 1 aim: I want to track a HTTP stream, find the SYN, follow the convo and analyze the contents-
Remember I can hover over the data in the convo to see which packet it's from, the amount of frames sent by the client and server in that specific stream.
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0 && tcp.port == 80 # Is my chosen command to begin with, I wish to see http as I don’t fancy trying to unencrypt HTTPS traffic on my first go lol.

I spotted a lot of http traffic, coming from one IP, realized it was my IP lol, it appears my laptop was using HTTP in the back round to gather certificates on this café's wifi im using, most strange as you'd expect microsoft to use HTTPS exclusively but the data is relatively useless.

Can check stream index on a TCP packet and filter down to track that stream using:
tcp.stream eq 50
