This repository collects a selection of my OneNote blog entries, focusing on the key things I’ve been teaching myself each week. 

Any technical evidence or examples I mention will usually live in my project repositories or my Technical Handbook OneNote. 

Think of this space as a reflection point — a place to track progress, consolidate learning, and document the journey.
