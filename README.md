# Technical Field Journal & Lab Notes

This repository serves as a centralized log of my weekly technical research, network laboratory experiments, and security findings. It acts as the bridge between my raw project code and my internal engineering handbook.



## Journal Objectives
The goal of this documentation is to record not just *what* was built, but the **decision-making process** behind the architecture. Each entry focuses on:
* **The "Why":** Identifying the specific problem or technology being explored.
* **Architecture & Topology:** Mapping out the network or system environment.
* **Troubleshooting Logs:** Documenting the "roadblocks" and the logic used to bypass them.
* **Key Findings:** Summarizing actionable insights for future deployments.

## Content Scope
Entries in this journal often correlate with developments in my [Engineering-Projects] repository, providing context for:
* **Network Infrastructure:** Implementation of VLANs, VPN tunnels, and firewall rule-sets in virtualized environments.
* **Security Auditing:** Observations from local system hardening and credential hygiene tests.
* **Lab Observations:** Deep-dives into Windows Internals, Intune behaviors, and Registry-level modifications.

## Lab Environment
Most findings are derived from a controlled sandbox environment consisting of:
* **Hypervisors:** [Insert e.g., VMware ESXi / Proxmox / VirtualBox]
* **Network Simulators:** [Insert e.g., GNS3 / Cisco Packet Tracer / EVE-NG]
* **Target Nodes:** Windows Server 2022, Windows 10/11 Pro (Intune Enrolled), and various Linux distributions.



## Professional Growth Tracking
This repository is updated weekly to reflect ongoing learning. It serves as a transparent record of my technical evolution, moving from basic networking fundamentals to complex security orchestration and automation.
