// Ai summary of notes from what i've learnt in week 1
Color theory 
- Limit palette to 3–5 colors: primary, secondary, accent, background, surface.
- Hierarchy by value: use darker/lighter tints of the same hue for emphasis and states.
- Use contrast for legibility: test text vs background; increase weight or size if contrast is low.
- Tokens: store colors as named styles in Figma (Primary/Accent/Surface) so updates propagate.

Spacing system (8px grid)
- Base unit: 8px. Build spacing as multiples: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48. Use 4px only for very small UI details.
- Why: consistent rhythm, easier handoff to devs, predictable scaling across breakpoints.
- How to set in Figma: add a Layout Grid to a frame, choose Grid (square) or Columns and set Gutter/Margin to match your 8px rhythm.

8px grid rules
- Align edges and gaps to multiples of 8px.
- Component padding: prefer 16px (2×8) for small controls, 24–32px for cards.
- Typography spacing: line-height should be multiple of 4 or 8 for vertical rhythm.

Auto Layout — step‑by‑step 
- Wrap content: Select layers → Auto Layout (Shift+A). This creates a frame that sizes to content.
- Direction: Choose Horizontal for rows, Vertical for stacks.
- Spacing between items: set the fixed gap (use 8/16/24).
- Padding: set top/right/bottom/left padding (use 8/16/24).
- Resizing rules: for children, pick Hug contents, Fill container, or Fixed to control stretch behavior.
- Nesting: combine Auto Layout frames (e.g., button text inside a padded frame, then multiple buttons in a horizontal frame).
- Alignment: use vertical/horizontal alignment controls to center or stretch items.
- Responsive: use Fill container on elements you want to expand when the parent resizes.

Quick Auto Layout tips
- Use fixed gaps (8/16) not manual spacers.
- Hover the pink handles to drag padding visually; use numeric inputs for precision.
- Convert groups to Auto Layout to make components responsive; test by changing text length.

Handoff & accessibility
- Export tokens: name color and spacing styles for dev handoff.
- Check contrast and label interactive elements. Use Figma plugins for contrast checks.
